# Mint-DefenderBox
Basic Mint with Security Tools

<b>It turns out the image is way too large to bring to GitHub so I uploaded it to my Google Drive and will share the link with you in a direct e-mail.   </b>

In the end though, it is a virtual machine implementing Linux Mint with some productivity and entertainment applications removed and some security tools addded.  We can use it to build monthly challenges so we can play around with security technology in a sandbox.

I intend for us to create scripts to update this base image for routine use and at some cadence will re-release the as-built image to allow members to download and be prodcutive faster (versus download an old image and update to the current workstation).  In order to use the VM you will need VMWare Workstation.

OPTION 2: Roll your own
