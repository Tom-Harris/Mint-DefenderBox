# Mint-DefenderBox
Basic Mint with Security Tools

This virtual machine is a basic Linux Mint with some productivity and entertainment applications removed and adding security tools over time.  It can be used to track monthly challenges and will be the "playground" for testing security tools, etc.

I intend to create scripts to update this base image for routine use and at some cadence will re-release the as-built image to allow members to download and be prodcutive faster.
