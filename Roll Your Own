Grab a copy of your favorite Linux distro.  I usually use Debian-based distro's to keep it simple.  Load either VMWare Player or VirtualBox to your workstation then use that to load a Linux VM.  Once the image is running and patched run follow these instructions to load Wireshark: https://techviewleo.com/how-to-install-wireshark-on-linux-mint/

I dont't see where they added the user to the Wireshark group so if you run into permissions issues, run this command:

sudo usermod -a -G wireshark $USER     # change $USER to the account you will use for wireshark
